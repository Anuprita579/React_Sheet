What is CDN? Why do we use it?
CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a network of servers which is distributed across various location to deliver web content more efficiently.
For example :
You want to watch a movie on your laptop. The movie is stored far away on the server. Getting the movie directly may take some time as it has to travel a distance. 
Now, let's say there are many copies of that movie in small servers located near your surrounding. So, CDN is like that small servers located near your surrounding.
So, now if you want to watch the movie, instead of fetching the movie from far away server, you can you the small servers located in your surrounding. So that it does not travel a long distance.

CDN is used for :
1. Faster Content delivery
2. Reducing Server Load
3. Load Balancing
4. Caching
5. Distributed security
6. Cost saving
